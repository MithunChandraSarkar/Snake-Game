# SnakeGame
In this project I am working on the Snake game. I am sure everyone has played this game or at least knows the basic rules of this game. 
Snake game is one of the common and popular game of childhood. Those of us who were born between 1990 and 2000 had a wonderful childhood then. 
Then there were no online games like now, there were no pubzi free-fire games.
Research has shown that gamers are far ahead in making quick decisions, iconic skills and visual attention.
Snake Game is entertaining and stress removal for the people have a problem in life.
The 4 number of keys to move the snake and that is: left, right, up and down.
When you eat the apple, the snake becomes one block bigger. If the snake hits its own body or  the walls of the screen, then  the game is over. The score is dependent ,that how many apples are you eaten.
